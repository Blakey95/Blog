My Project so Far

My character is based on the video game character from the Prince of Persia Series. 
The main challenges I had was making my character look like the prince from the games but also making sure it’s not too detailed.
I am not very good at drawing so this was quite challenging for me. 
I think he turned out alright despite me not being good at drawing. At first I put a lot of detail in to my character with all the clothing and extra chains/swords, etc. 
But I realised that I needed to tone it down a bit. 
So I started to remove some of the clothing and swords that weren’t really needed to begin with in my new drawing. 
I ended up with a character that isn’t too detailed but also not under detailed. My other challenge was with the background. 
I wanted to make a background that was similar to the scenery in the game. 
The trouble was that there are a good few sceneries to choose from and I wasn’t sure what to pick. 
So in the end I decided to choose one that was a bit of all the scenery in the game.
I think I accomplished this quite well and am quite happy with the results.
